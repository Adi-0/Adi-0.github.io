           <h1>ADITYA KUMAR.sh</h1>
            <p>Hi! Most people call me Adi. I am a Minecraft lover that strives to understand the world of boards and silicon on a deeper level.</p>
           <p> The phrase, "you will never work a day in your life if you enjoy what you are doing" has been used by many; but I genuinely live by it. I think I have found something special in this field that resonates with me, and I don't intend to let it go easily. I hope to log parts of my journey with the intention of sharing it with others.</p>
           <p>Whether you are here for my portfolio or just to know more about me, I hope you enjoy this site as much as I enjoyed putting it together, thanks for being here!</p>
