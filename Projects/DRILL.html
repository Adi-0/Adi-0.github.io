        <h3>1|CONTEXT</h3>
        <p>I love most of my projects, but this one holds a special place in my heart as this was my first official
          and complete project that involved designing a board and turning it into an actual machine from total scratch.
          The number of all nighters I spent in random rooms and solder stations made it feel like I was being thrown
          off into the deep end (I was). However, the experience was completely worth it.</p>

        <p>From relearning circuit theory (RLC circuits feel like sorcery at times still) all over again to learning how
          to create a BOM and search and order parts from sites like DigiKey, to finally discovering how to properly
          hold an iron in a way that wouldn't end up with me burning myself every hour, this project singlehandedly
          taught me the fundamentals of practically everything. Most if not all of the concepts I have learned here
          apply to me and are essential in whatever I work on to this day, so it seems only fitting to put this here.
        </p>

        <h3>2|OVERVEIW</h3>
        <p> I designed and constructed a PCB board based an LM555 Oscillator-based circuit that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Converts 20V battery power to 6V using a RLC based buck converter (to efficiently utilize the motor)</li>
          <li>Regulated motor speed based on a 10K potentiometer input</li>
          <li>Utilized an H bridge to control the direction of the motor, with a switch serving as the input from the
            user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I had go in-depth about RLC circuits and brush up on related circuit theory to actually design a schematic
          properly. Additionally, I used the same 555 timer for various other small breadboard projects to get
          a good idea about what to do and how to use the IC to its full potential. Even then however, I still ran into
          many challenges and obstacles when trying to put together a proper schematic. This is to be expected given
          that I did this in a time where the entire EDA design process was new and foreign to me. Sure, I had
          experience with repairing ewaste and other electronics in the past. However, this was completely different
          since I never created something original from absolutely nothing.</p>

        <p class=center>F1: EAGLE Schematic Editor</p>


        <p>With enough time though, things took a positive turn. And right before I resorted to pulling my hair out, I
          had a schematic that both included actual part libraries backed by the power of sound math. Once everything
          miraculously checked out in theory and in tbe EAGLE schematic (before the
          tragic news of its discontinuation in 2026 was announced) these components were sourced and then
          tested on a breadboard with a standard oscilloscope and
          multimeter, and then soldered onto a 2" Adafruit perf board before being turned into a PCB design.
        </p>


        <h3>3|ANALYSIS</h3>
        
        <p>Truthfully? This was less of a first cool gadget and more of a rite of passage for me at the end. From this
          one board, I got the opportunity to learn what resilience and problem solving really meant when it came to working with both EDA software. I
          also discovered the immediate rush of serotonin one feels when the vision they had finally exists in a
          tangible and physical way, and since then I don't think I can go back.</p>
