        <h3>1|CONTEXT</h3>
        <p>I love most of my projects, but this one holds a special place in my heart since this was my first official
          and complete project that involved designing a board and turning it into an actual machine from total scratch.
          The number of all nighters I spent in random rooms and solder stations made it feel like I was being thrown
          off into the deep end (I was). However, the experience was completely worth it.</p>
        <p>From relearning circuit theory (RLC circuits feel like sorcery at times still) all over again to learning how
          to create a BOM and search and order parts from sites like DigiKey, to finally discovering how to properly
          hold an iron in a way that wouldn't end up with me burning myself every hour, this project singlehandedly
          taught me the fundamentals of practically everything. Most if not all of the concepts I have learned here
          apply to me and are essential in whatever I work on to this day, so it seems only fitting to put this here.
          Also, it's a really cool project!</p>

        <h3>2|OVERVEIW</h3>
        <p> I designed and constructed a PCB board based an LM555 Oscillator-based circuit that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Converts 20V battery power to 6V using a RLC based buck converter (to efficiently utilize the motor)</li>
          <li>Regulated motor speed based on a 10K potentiometer input</li>
          <li>Utilized an H bridge to control the direction of the motor, with a switch as the input</li>

        </ul>
        <p>test</p>

        <p> <b>[PLACEHOLDER FROM LINKEDIN. MORE SPACE HERE TO DETAIL THOUGH.]</b> Components were sourced and then tested on a breadboard with a standard oscilloscope and
          multimeter, then soldered onto a 2" Adafruit perf board before being turned into a PCB design with Autodesk
          Eagle.
