            <h3>1|CONTEXT</h3>

            <p>I thought that this project in particular was worth mentioning here because, while it isn't the most impressive thing ever, designing this ring taught me a lot of fundamental concepts in the PCB design process that I use to this day. Therefore, I feel like it is one of the more impactful projects I have gotten the opportunity to work on.</p>
            <p>The concept is simple enough on its own. Back when Slugbotics (A really cool college robotics club at UCSC... shameless plug but theres <b>more info on that on my resume :D</b>), had only 3 teams for the ROV; one of the responsibilities for the electrical department were finding solutions to any requirement for the vehicle that delt with PCBs or power management. The visibility issues for the camera were one of those, and while I was still very new to </p>
