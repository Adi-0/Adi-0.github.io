            <h3>1|CONTEXT</h3>

            <p>This board isn't the most complex thing ever, but designing this ring taught me much of the fundamental concepts in the PCB design process I use to this day. Because it's one of the more impactful projects I have gotten the opportunity to work on in terms of self growth, I decided it's worth it to specifically mention this project on my site.</p>
            <p>First off though, given that we're in the "context" section of the page, a backstory wouldn't hurt. Slugbotics (A vibrant and geeky robotics club at UCSC... more info on that on my resume!), had only 3 teams for the ROV; one of the responsibilities for the electrical department involved finding solutions to any requirement for the vehicle that delt with PCBs or power management. Issues pertaining to visibility underwater for our cameras was a major focus for our team.</p>
            <p>Having been using EDA software for 5 months prior to this specific project, I still felt very green in various areas yet confident enough to tackle the board for the actual light fixture on my own. That isn't to say that I didn't borrow concepts from the lights used in previous years or those in other projects to optimize the design, there was a lot to learn from past successes and mistakes and I firmly believe continuous improvement comes from looking around us first.</p>
            <p>That's a gist of the background behind this board, but it's about time that we get into the actual design.</p>
            
            <h3>2|DESIGN</h3>
            
            <ul>There were a few main ideas to consider when designing this board:<br></br>
              <li>The camera must be provided with enough light to veiw the ROV's surroundings.</li>
              
              <li>Efficiency is key, since the ROV 48V PSU needs to be used for other crucial systems as well.</li>
              
              <li>The light will be housed in an airtight enclosure. [AKA: HEAT]</li>
              
            <p>Since the the leds are meant to be used for a camera underwater</p>
            
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Test </li>
                <li>idk</li>
            </ul>
